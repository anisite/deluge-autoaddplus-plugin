# deluge-autoaddplus-plugin
Adds multiple watch folder AND subfolders support to Deluge

##Same goodness of the built-in deluge autoadd plugin but...
With this version, the plugin watch folders and subfolders on it!
Example, if you add watch folder to **T:\Add torrents here\** and specify you want move torrents at end of download to **T:\Completed\** you will be able to create any sub-tree you want like : **T:\Add torrents here\Movies\Comedy\** and auto add plus will automatically add torrents to download and set "move at end to" directory to **T:\Completed\Movies\Comedy\**. FANTASTIC!

All you need to keep all your torrent folder clean!
